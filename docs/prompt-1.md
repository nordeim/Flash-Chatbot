please meticulously and critically review and analyze the codebase in the current folder, then think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to re-imagine a better design based on this sample application, then meticulously plan to create a master execution plan (ToDo list) for modifying the codebase to implement the improved and re-imagined design, at the same time, change the API to use the Nvidia API (see @nv_api_template.py as an example). Break down the master execution plan into logical phases which can be executed independently, and for each phase, list out the list of files to add or modify, and list/describe the changes with integrated checklist for each file to be added or modified. Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology in planning your execution. Review and validate the master execution plan before proceeding meticulously.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously review the shared codebase again, then think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to re-imagine a 'memory' system that can enhance the user experience so that the user will not feel like talking to another stranger when he starts a new chat.
