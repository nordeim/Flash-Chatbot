please meticulously and critically review and analyze the codebase in the current folder, then think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to re-imagine a better design based on this sample application, then meticulously plan to create a master execution plan (ToDo list) for modifying the codebase to implement the improved and re-imagined design, at the same time, change the API to use the Nvidia API (see @nv_api_template.py as an example). Break down the master execution plan into logical phases which can be executed independently, and for each phase, list out the list of files to add or modify, and list/describe the changes with integrated checklist for each file to be added or modified. Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology in planning your execution. Review and validate the master execution plan before proceeding meticulously.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution. Now, please meticulously review the shared codebase again, then think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how best to re-imagine a 'memory' system that can enhance the user experience so that the user will not feel like talking to another stranger when he starts a new chat.

Awesome job on your meticulous review, analysis and planning. Please keep up the good work. Now, please meticulously review the codebase files to align your understanding of the current state of the project and the actual implemention. Then meticulously create a briefing document for an AI coding agent to be able to continue from the present state. After conducting your meticulous codebase review to align your understanding of the codebase, you will create a comprehensive *single-source-of-truth* briefing document for any coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the project and the current codebase status. Save the agent *briefing document* that captures your aligned and validated understanding as a markdown file `CLAUDE.md`.

Please meticulously review @ARCHITECTURE.md , @README.md , @code_review.md , @VALIDATED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md , @TODO.md , @RAG_PROGRESS.md, @SESSION_PHASE_SUMMARY.md , @status_new.md , @status_new_2.md , @Dockerfile and @main.py to have a deep understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project and its codebase design and architecture. Next meticulously review the codebase files to align your understanding of the current state of the project and the actual implemention. Then meticulously create a briefing document for an AI coding agent to be able to continue from the present state. After conducting your meticulous codebase review to align your understanding of the codebase, you will create a comprehensive *single-source-of-truth* briefing document for any coding agent or human developer to have the same deep understanding of the project and the current codebase status.
