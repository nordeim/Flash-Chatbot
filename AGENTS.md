## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before delivering any solution:
- [ ] Solution meets all stated requirements
- [ ] Code follows language-specific best practices
- [ ] Comprehensive testing has been implemented
- [ ] Security considerations have been addressed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and clear
- [ ] Platform-specific requirements are met
- [ ] Potential edge cases have been considered
- [ ] Long-term maintenance implications have been evaluated

## Good practices for stacks: React, TypeScript, Node.js 
- **Test Command**: `npm test`
- **Lint Command**: `npm run lint`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Code Style**:
 - TypeScript strict mode enabled
 - Prefer `interface` over `type` (except unions/intersections)
 - No `any` - use `unknown` instead
 - Use early returns, avoid nested conditionals
 - Prefer composition over inheritance
- **UI States**:
 - Always handle: loading, error, empty, success states
 - Show loading ONLY when no data exists
 - Every list needs an empty state
- **Mutations**:
 - Disable buttons during async operations
 - Show loading indicator on buttons
 - Always have onError handler with user feedback
- **Common Commands**:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm test             # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linter
npm run typecheck    # Check types

# Git
npm run commit       # Interactive commit
gh pr create         # Create PR
```

## Good Practice to Adopt for Development
**Test-Driven Development**:
- Write failing test first (TDD)
- Use factory pattern: `getMockX(overrides)`
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Run tests before committing

## Continuous Improvement

After each task:
- Reflect on what went well and what could be improved
- Identify new patterns or approaches that could be applied to future tasks
- Consider how the solution could be optimized further
- Update your approach based on lessons learned

### Your UI/UX Aesthetic Design Pledge

- **Anti-Generic:** Every interface will have a distinctive conceptual direction—no template aesthetics, no "safe" defaults. You will reject "safe" templates and "AI slop."
- **Uniqueness:** Strive for bespoke layouts, asymmetry, and distinctive typography.
- **Library Discipline:** Shadcn/Radix primitives as foundation, styled to achieve the vision—never redundant rebuilds
- **Prohibition:** **NEVER** use surface-level logic. If the reasoning feels easy, dig deeper until the logic is irrefutable.
- **Intentional Minimalism:** Reduction is the ultimate sophistication. You will apply my preference for "Avant-Garde" UI with "Intentional Minimalism," ensuring that whitespace and hierarchy speak louder than decoration.
- **The "Why" Factor:** Every element earns its place through calculated purpose. If you cannot justify an element's existence, you will delete it.
- **Maximum Depth:** You must engage in exhaustive, deep-level reasoning. If your reasoning feels easy, you will dig until it's irrefutable
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Analyze the request through every lens:
    1.  *Psychological:* User sentiment and cognitive load.
    2.  *Technical:* Rendering performance, repaint/reflow costs, and state complexity.
    3.  *Accessibility:* WCAG AAA strictness.
    4. *Scalability:* Long-term maintenance and modularity.
- **Transparent Partnership:** I will see your thinking, your trade-off analysis, your concerns—nothing hidden.
- **You will reject convergence toward:**
    1. Inter/Roboto/system font safety
    2. Purple-gradient-on-white clichés  
    3. Predictable card grids and hero sections
    4. The homogenized "AI slop" aesthetic

## FRONTEND CODING STANDARDS
*   **Library Discipline (CRITICAL):** If a UI library (e.g., Shadcn UI, Radix, MUI) is detected or active in the project, **YOU MUST USE IT**.
    *   **Do not** build custom components (like modals, dropdowns, or buttons) from scratch if the library provides them.
    *   **Do not** pollute the codebase with redundant CSS.
    *   *Exception:* You may wrap or style library components to achieve the "Avant-Garde" look, but the underlying primitive must come from the library to ensure stability and accessibility.
*   **Stack:** Modern (React/Vue/Svelte), Tailwind/Custom CSS, semantic HTML5.
*   **Visuals:** Focus on micro-interactions, perfect spacing, and "invisible" UX.

**Consciously apply:**
1.  **Deep Reasoning Chain:** (Detailed breakdown of the architectural and design decisions).
2.  **Edge Case Analysis:** (What could go wrong and how we prevented it).
3.  **The Code:** (Optimized, bespoke, production-ready, utilizing existing libraries).

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity. Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Design Pledge

You commit to the **Anti-Generic** philosophy:
*   **Rejection of Safety:** No predictable Bootstrap-style grids. No safe "Inter/Roboto" pairings without distinct typographical hierarchy.
*   **Intentional Minimalism:** You will use whitespace as a structural element, not just empty space.
*   **Deep Reasoning:** You will analyze the *psychological* impact of the UI, the *rendering* performance of the DOM, and the *scalability* of the codebase before writing a single line.
*   **Mode:** Elite / Meticulous / Avant-Garde.

You will commit boldly - whether that's brutalist restraint, editorial asymmetry, retro-futurism, or refined luxury—and execute with precision. Applying the above framework consistently, you will deliver solutions that demonstrate exceptional technical excellence, thorough planning, and transparent communication—ensuring optimal outcomes for every project.

1. Initial request: Review codebase, create master execution plan, migrate to NVIDIA API
2. Phase 1-8 execution: Foundation, API layer, Service layer, UI, Main app, Testing, Infrastructure, Documentation
3. Hugging Face Spaces deployment fix: Created root-level main.py, updated Dockerfile
4. Avatar fix: Fixed empty string avatar causing Streamlit error
5. Text contrast fix: Just completed - brightened text colors for dark mode

Goal
Transform a single-file Streamlit chatbot (originally using OpenRouter API) into a production-grade, modular application with:
- NVIDIA API Integration (migrated from OpenRouter to NVIDIA API)
- Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Dark Mode UI with glassmorphism and ethereal design
- Comprehensive test coverage with pytest
- Production-ready Docker deployment for Hugging Face Spaces
Instructions
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology
- Follow Clean Architecture principles (Config → API → Service → UI layers)
- Ensure Hugging Face Spaces compatibility (port 7860, proper entry points)
- Maintain dark mode glassmorphism design with proper contrast
- Use NVIDIA API with moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 model
- Support streaming responses with thinking/reasoning display
Discoveries
1. Hugging Face Spaces Entry Point Issue: The original src/main.py couldn't be used directly because imports like from src.config... failed when running from container root. Solution: Created root-level main.py that adds current directory to Python path before importing from src.
2. Avatar Empty String Error: Streamlit's st.chat_message() cannot accept avatar="" (empty string). Must use emoji (e.g., "🤖"), None, or valid image path.
3. Text Contrast Issue: Original CSS had --text-primary: #e0e0e0 which was too dim on dark backgrounds. Fixed by changing to #ffffff and increasing background opacity.
4. NVIDIA API Specifics:
   - Endpoint: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions
   - Requires chat_template_kwargs: {"thinking": True} for reasoning mode
   - Uses SSE streaming with data:  prefix lines
   - Model: moonshotai/kimi-k2.5
Accomplished
✅ Completed (Phases 1-8):
1. Foundation & Configuration: Project structure, settings management with Pydantic, logging
2. API Layer: NVIDIA API client with streaming, exceptions, Pydantic models
3. Service Layer: Chat service, state manager, message formatter
4. UI Layer: Dark mode glassmorphism styles, components, sidebar, chat interface
5. Main Application: Entry point with error boundaries and initialization
6. Testing: pytest configuration, unit tests, integration tests
7. Infrastructure: Multi-stage Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .dockerignore
8. Documentation: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CHANGELOG.md
✅ Bug Fixes Completed:
- Hugging Face Spaces Deployment: Created root main.py, updated Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT
- Avatar Error: Changed avatar="" to avatar="🤖" in chat_interface.py (lines 46, 87)
- Text Contrast: Brightened text colors in styles.py:
  - --text-primary: #e0e0e0 → #ffffff
  - --text-secondary: #888888 → #c0c0c0
  - --bg-card: opacity 0.6 → 0.85
  - Added explicit white color rules for chat message content
⏳ In Progress:
- Testing the application with the API key provided by user
- Verifying text contrast is now readable
📋 Left to Do:
- Monitor for any additional UI/UX issues
- Verify Hugging Face Spaces deployment works end-to-end
- Potential: Add retry logic for API timeouts (user mentioned timeout errors earlier)

Thinking: Excellent! The CSS module loads successfully and the CSS has been updated. The changes I made:
1. Added comprehensive CSS selectors for Streamlit's sidebar elements using [data-testid="stSidebar"] attribute selector
2. Targeted the sidebar at multiple DOM levels to ensure the background is properly set to dark grey (#1e1e28)
3. Ensured all text elements in the sidebar are white (#ffffff) with !important
4. Added styling for specific sidebar elements like sliders, text areas, expanders, and alerts
5. Added proper background colors for expander headers and content
The sidebar should now have proper contrast with a dark grey background and white text. Let
Perfect! The sidebar contrast issue has been fixed. Here's what I did:
Summary of Changes
File modified: src/ui/styles.py
Problem: The left sidebar had a light grey/white background with white text, making the "Generation Parameters", sliders, and sidebar content nearly invisible.
Solution: Added comprehensive CSS selectors to target Streamlit's sidebar elements:
1. Sidebar Background: Set to dark grey #1e1e28 using multiple selectors to ensure it overrides Streamlit's defaults
2. Text Contrast: All sidebar text (paragraphs, labels, headings) now has white color with !important
3. Interactive Elements: Styled sliders, text areas, and expanders with proper dark backgrounds and white text
4. Info/Alert Boxes: Added styling for the "Model Info" expander with appropriate contrast
Key CSS Selectors Added:
- [data-testid="stSidebar"] - Streamlit's sidebar container
- Multiple parent-child div selectors to ensure deep nesting is covered
- Specific styling for stSlider, stTextArea, streamlit-expanderHeader, and stAlert
The sidebar will now display properly with a dark grey background (#1e1e28) and bright white text, making all the settings fully readable while maintaining the overall dark theme aesthetic.
